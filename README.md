Things are very messy, rewriting things on the side.

Window size setting must be set to **small** in game settings. Needs viramate for hotkeys and hosting last hosted coop quest because I'm lazy.

# Usage
* python gbf.py [profile_name] [options]
* The script will pause upon starting up. Hit enter to unpause when the coop room is all set up and summons are picked.

# Flags
Temp
* --hostslime, --leechslime, --debug (start script in interactive mode)

# Installation
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* place [chrome webdriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) binary in the folder
* chromium (or whatever works for you)
